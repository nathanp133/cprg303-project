# Menu Navigation

## Status
What type of navigation system should our app have?

## Context
We want our app to have a minimalistic look, and to avoid unnecessary clutter in our interface. We think that both the tab navigation and the bottom tab navigation take up too much space on our main screen.

## Decision
We will be using a drawer navigation system.

## Consequences
We should have a menu button to access different screens. The same page should also be accessed with a swipe gesture.
