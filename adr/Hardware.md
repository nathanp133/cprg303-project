# Hardware

## Status
Will any hardware from the mobile devices be needed for our app?

## Context
Hardware in this context is talking about sensors or systems like the gyroscope, GPS, speakers/microphone, camera. 

## Decision
We will use the gyroscope built into the phone to help rotate the screen of the calculator.

## Consequences
We can allow the user to shift from normal calculator to a scientific calculator since more functions need to be displayed on the screen and with landscape mode, we get more screen space to work with.
