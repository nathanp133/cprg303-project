## Status
What UI toolkit should be used in development?

## Context
Deciding on a UI toolkit to use. Since we do not know exactly what UI elements will be needed yet, this is not set in stone. For now, sticking to native solutions seems to be a safe choice. 

## Decision
We plan on using react native elements because it has easy integration with react. If there are any icons or components, we cannot find in react native elements, then we will look for them on ant design mobile. 


## Consequences
If at some point down the line we cannot find what we need from react native elements or ant design mobile, we will look at the following sources: Native Base, Shoutem UI, UI Kitten
